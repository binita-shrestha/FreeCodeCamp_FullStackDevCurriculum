# FreeCodeCamp_FullStackDevCurriculum
I am adding html css and java exercises that I complete as a part of Free Code Camp Full Stack Dev Curriculum.
Follow my journey to learn with and break into tech as a non-traditional student. :)

Items learned:
1. HTML Boilerplate
2. Linking CSS file
3. Making hyperlinks more responsive (e.g. targe=_blank will open the link in a new browser tab)
